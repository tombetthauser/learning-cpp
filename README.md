# Learning C++

### Some Context and Resource Links

If you are coming from primarily writing JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize. It can be a great language to pick up not only because so many resources use it for code examples (ie Cracking the Coding Interview) but also because it will expose you to a compiled language, expose you to using types, give you experience in a language not connected directly to web development and also because if you have some experience with JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize.

## Resources

The following external resources might provide you with all the basic introduction you need. After you get the basic syntax down in any new language a great next step is simply to start doing easy leetcode problems that you're very comfortable with and checking the leetcode discussion section to get exposed to new syntax alternatives and patterns. After this finding code along mini-projects on youtube etc can be a fun way to deepen your experience, especially with a non-web-oriented language like C++ where the common uses may not be immediately apparent.
