# Resources for Learning C++

### Some Context and Resource Links

If you are coming from primarily writing JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize. It can be a great language to pick up not only because so many resources use it for code examples (ie Cracking the Coding Interview) but also because it will expose you to a compiled language, expose you to using types, give you experience in a language not connected directly to web development and also because if you have some experience with JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize.

### Similarities to JavaScript

A lot of C++ syntax looks and feels very similar to JavaScript. For loops, while loops, if statements, function delaration and invocation will all look familiar. This is not a coincidence, historically JavaScript (first developed by Brendan Eich in December 1995) took a great deal of syntactic influence from Java (Oracle Corp. May 1995) which took influence from many languages including C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup, 1985). For broader context the syntactic similarities between JavaScript and C++ go back even further to the C language (Dennis Ritchie / Bell Labs, 1972) which was built as a follow-up to the B language (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie / Bell Labs, 1969) which took influence from BCPL, Basic Combined Programming Language (Martin Richards / University of Cambridge, 1967). BCPL is essentially where the JavaScript syntactic similarities end as it is commonly recognised to be the oldest programming language to use curly braces to denote code blocks. Prior to this keyboards did not even have curly brackets.

## Resources

The following external resources might provide you with all the basic introduction you need. After you get the basic syntax down in any new language a great next step is simply to start doing easy leetcode problems that you're very comfortable with and checking the leetcode discussion section to get exposed to new syntax alternatives and patterns. After this finding code along mini-projects on youtube etc can be a fun way to deepen your experience, especially with a non-web-oriented language like C++ where the common uses may not be immediately apparent.
