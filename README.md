# Resources for Learning C++

### Some Context and Resource Links

If you are coming from primarily writing JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize. It can be a great language to pick up not only because so many resources use it for code examples (ie Cracking the Coding Interview) but also because it will expose you to a compiled language, expose you to using types, give you experience in a language not connected directly to web development and also because if you have some experience with JavaScript you already know more C++ syntax than you might realize.

### Similarities to JavaScript

A lot of C++ syntax looks and feels very similar to JavaScript. For loops, while loops, if statements, function delaration and invocation will all look familiar. This is not a coincidence, historically JavaScript (first developed by Brendan Eich in December 1995) took a great deal of syntactic influence from Java (Oracle Corp. May 1995) which took influence from many languages including C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup, 1985). 

For broader context the syntactic similarities between JavaScript and C++ go back even further to the C language (Dennis Ritchie / Bell Labs, 1972) which was built as a follow-up to the B language (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie / Bell Labs, 1969) which took influence from BCPL, Basic Combined Programming Language (Martin Richards / University of Cambridge, 1967). BCPL is essentially where the JavaScript syntactic similarities end as it is commonly recognised to be the oldest programming language to use curly braces to denote code blocks. Prior to this keyboards did not even have curly brackets. 

Whether or not all that is of interest to the average JavaScript programmer interested in C++ it does mean the lineage of some of JavaScript's most defining syntax and patterns go back over half a century!

### Compiled Language

Somewhat confusingly compiled languages like C++ have one enourmous differences from interpreted languages like JavaScript, they need to be compiled before you can run the code and see what it's behavior is. This means that we have to explicitly run the C++ code we write through a compiler in the command line before executing the file that gets created by this compiling process. 

This is much simpler than it can sound the first time you encounter a compiled language. You can still work in Visual Studio Code and it only takes a few seconds to compile your code. One benefit to working with a compiled language is that you will be able to get warnings and errors from the compiler when you compile the code before actually running it.

### Typed Language

Typed languages like C++ are different from languages like JavaScript because they require programmers to tell the computer what datatype a variable is when they declare it. Depending on the language you may also have to specifically delcare the datatype of the inputs and outputs of functions. Like the process of compiling, this has the benefit of helping us catch errors and unintended behaviors in our code before actually executing it.

### Career Path

One extra note about learning languages like C++, Java, C etc is that they are generally associated with a software engineering career path that is further away from the web and "closer to the metal" or closer to the hardware that houses and executes the code you write and further away from the end user in many cases. This isn't necessarily better or worse than a career path that stays closer to the web, but it is a part of the industry that experiences fewer changes than web-development and therefore is often associated with long-term career stability. With that said it is also often viewed as a less interesting career path for the same reasons. 

Regardless learning one of these languages is a great way to diversify your resume and portfolio for those of us that learned software engineering via web-oriented languages and frameworks.

## Resources

The following external resources might provide you with all the basic introduction you need. After you get the basic syntax down in any new language a great next step is simply to start doing easy leetcode problems that you're very comfortable with and checking the leetcode discussion section to get exposed to new syntax alternatives and patterns. After this finding code along mini-projects on youtube etc can be a fun way to deepen your experience, especially with a non-web-oriented language like C++ where the common uses may not be immediately apparent.
